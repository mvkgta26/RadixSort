# 2-Way RadixSort


## CUDA Implementation of 2-Way Radix Sort for integers


## Core Algorithm: Array arr[] of size n:
### Repeat for i = 0 --> i = 31
  1. *Compact* all the elements of arr[] array based on following *predicate*: Check if bit-i is 1
  2. Produce a *Blelloch Scan* of the Compact array
  3. Use the scan array as *Scatter-Addresses* to do the *Split For Bit-i*:   
        a. All the elements with bit-i == 0 are grouped in the beginning. Original order between them is retained  
        b. All elements with bit-i == 1 are grouped in the end. Original order between them is retained
